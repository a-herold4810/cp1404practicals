# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were about an 7/10, there were some parts of pracs that I was able to complete much quicker or the complete opposite where they took a lot longer. But I would say the majority were only within a couple of minutes.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Honestly, I wouldn't say it improved that much. The main reason being, each prac was learning more and more new things. Yes there were sections that was the same skill from the week before or very similar. But currently, i don't think I have enough data points to say things are moving up and to the right.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I think the biggest learning has been, sometimes the things that seem simple, can be the biggest pain when it comes to making sure they actually work. And to bring timeframes down, we need to practice, practice, practice. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I've found this part quite hard. Out of all the weeks since we started code reviews in prac 6, I think I have actually only had it happen a couple of times. With only one actually providing constructive feedback to help better my code. It is definitely something that will improve as people do it more and more, but currently, I haven't seen the benefits that it would normally bring.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Again, similar to the above, I haven't had many actually come through, so it is hard to say. The ones I have had, have been great learnings. There were a couple of instances that I know helped improve my coding as I was able to see the differences between my code and another persons, and learn from how they were doing things iteratively.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.
