# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Currently, I haven't changed too much from what I found to work really well in Programming 1. However, I have found I need to give myself more allocated time to get things done. A few of the concepts have been tripping me up.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think it is more around spending the time to hand write things more. Especially with the exam being hand written and just around the corner!

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've been spending a fair bit of time pulling the questions apart before attempting to start them. This has been instrumental in working iteratively and ensuring i hit all the right spots with the pracs and assignment.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I think I need to stop worrying about exact formating of the sample outputs while I am testing and working through the question, coming back towards the end when everything is working to add that in. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would love a bit more time with the assignments, trying to juggle full-time work, the pracs, lectures, workshops and the assignments has been a bit of a struggle at times. However, I think that is more a me problem than a you problem!
