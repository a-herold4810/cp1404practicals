# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I have blocked in a my calendar a couple of times to watch the lectures. Most of the time is on Saturday's and Sundays,
as I work full-time during the week so it is easier to focus on them on weekends, however I do have a 2 hour window on 
tuesday mornings that I have blocked so I can work on anything that might have been missed over the weekend.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Like Programming 1, having the time blocked so I can't get too distracted is super important and beneficial for me. So 
will keep doing that.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I don't think anything in particular. It might make sense to slow down tho as we are only at teh end of week 1 (before 
the pracs are due) and I have finished Prac 2.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I think making sure I read every part of a question or instructions first word by word is super important for me.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Being only week 2, this one is a hard one to answer. And I will come back to answer this as time progresses.
