# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me

I'm a masters student, currently completing my Masters in Science (Aquaculture).
I decided to take programming 1 and 2 so I could learn a little more about what the devs at work do day-to-day. Being
the
Head of Customer Success at Aphex, knowing just a little more about development can do a long way in helping understand
timelines and possibilities!

## 3 lessons of clean code

- SRP - Single Responsibility Principle for functions. Ensuring that functions other than main() have a single role and
  can be used repeatably.
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Docstrings/comments are your friend. Use them to explain what functions or bits of code are meant to do so you can
  keep coming back to them.
